# RubixCubeProject
Fun project in work that I was doing to represent a rubix cube and learn more about swing and created user interfaces I ran out of time this summer, but
the next step is to allow the cube to solve itself (though first I should probably learn myself how to solve one). I initially tried to use cube objects instead of square objects, where each 
cube had three colors for a corner, two for an edge, or one for a center piece, though I switched to using squares instead because it was simpler. Inthe future I would love to challenge myself by creating the cube
by using cube objects instead of square objects along with allowing the cube to solve itself.
